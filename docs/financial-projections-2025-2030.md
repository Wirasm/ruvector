### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Definition:** Total profit from one customer over their lifetime

**Calculation:**
- LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

**Example (2027):**
- ARPU: $6.50/month = $78/year
- Gross Margin: 78%
- Churn: 2%/month = 24%/year
- LTV = ($78 × 0.78) / 0.24 = $253.5

**Targets by Year:**
- 2025: $150 (high churn, low margin)
- 2026: $220
- 2027: $254
- 2028: $320
- 2029-2030: $400+ (low churn, high margin)

---

### LTV/CAC Ratio

**Definition:** Ratio of customer lifetime value to acquisition cost

**Benchmark:**
- <1x: Unsustainable (losing money on each customer)
- 1-3x: Acceptable (but tight)
- 3-5x: Good (healthy business)
- >5x: Excellent (highly profitable)

**PersonaChip LTV/CAC:**
- 2025: $150 / $100 = 1.5x (acceptable, pilot)
- 2026: $220 / $60 = 3.7x (good)
- 2027: $254 / $50 = 5.1x (excellent)
- 2028: $320 / $40 = 8x (exceptional)
- 2029-2030: $400 / $30 = 13.3x (best-in-class)

---

### Payback Period

**Definition:** Months to recover CAC from gross profit

**Calculation:**
- Payback = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)

**Example (2027):**
- CAC: $50
- ARPU: $6.50/month
- Gross Margin: 78%
- Payback = $50 / ($6.50 × 0.78) = 9.8 months

**Targets by Year:**
- 2025: 24 months (long, acceptable for pilot)
- 2026: 12 months (improving)
- 2027: 10 months (good)
- 2028: 7 months (excellent)
- 2029-2030: 5 months (exceptional)

**Benchmark:**
- <6 months: Excellent
- 6-12 months: Good
- 12-18 months: Acceptable
- >18 months: Poor

## 7. Key Financial Metrics

### Rule of 40

**Definition:** Growth Rate + Profit Margin ≥ 40% (benchmark for healthy SaaS)

**PersonaChip Rule of 40:**

| Year | Revenue Growth | EBITDA Margin | Rule of 40 Score |
|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 2026 | 110,000% | -7% | 109,993% ✅ |
| 2027 | 1,082% | 55% | 1,137% ✅ |

| 2029 | 300% | 64% | 364% ✅ |
| 2030 | 150% | 74% | 224% ✅ |

**Interpretation:** Exceptional (way above 40% benchmark)

---

### Magic Number

**Definition:** Measure of sales efficiency (how much revenue growth per $1 of S&M spend)

**Calculation:**
- Magic Number = (New ARR in Quarter) / (S&M Spend in Prior Quarter)

**Benchmark:**
- <0.5: Poor (unprofitable growth)
- 0.5-0.75: Acceptable
- 0.75-1.0: Good
- >1.0: Excellent (capital efficient growth)

**PersonaChip Magic Number:**
- 2026: 0.8 (good, ramping)
- 2027: 1.2 (excellent, viral growth kicking in)
- 2028: 1.5 (exceptional, network effects)
- 2029-2030: 2.0+ (best-in-class)

---

### Net Dollar Retention (NDR)

**Definition:** Revenue retention from existing customers (expansion - churn)

**Formula:**
- NDR = (Revenue from Cohort in Year N) / (Revenue from Cohort in Year N-1)

**Components:**
- Gross Retention: 95% (5% churn)
- Expansion (upsells, usage growth): +20%
- **Net Retention: 115%**

**Benchmark:**
- <100%: Shrinking (churn > expansion)
- 100-110%: Acceptable
- 110-120%: Good
- >120%: Excellent

**PersonaChip NDR:**
- 2026: 105% (acceptable, early product)
- 2027: 115% (good, expansion kicking in)
- 2028-2030: 120%+ (excellent, mature product)

## 8. Scenario Analysis

### Base Case (Presented Above)

**Assumptions:**
- OEM partnerships on track (Samsung 2026, Google 2026)
- Conversion: 10% (free → premium)
- Churn: 2-3%/month (good)
- International expansion on schedule
- No major competitive threats (Apple delayed until 2027)

**Outcome:**
- 2027: $780M revenue, 100M users, profitable
- 2030: $42B revenue, 5B users, $23B profit

---

### Bull Case (Optimistic)

**Assumptions:**
- OEM partnerships exceed expectations (Samsung + Google + Apple partnership)
- Conversion: 15% (excellent product-market fit)
- Churn: 1%/month (best-in-class)
- Faster international expansion (China success)
- Network effects accelerate viral growth

**Outcome:**

| Year | Users | Revenue | Net Income | Valuation |
|------|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 2027 | 200M | $1.5B | $800M | $15B |
| 2030 | 8B | $80B | $50B | $800B |

**Key Difference:** 2x revenue vs base case (driven by higher conversion + China)

---

### Bear Case (Pessimistic)

**Assumptions:**
- OEM partnerships delayed (Samsung launches 2027 vs 2026)
- Conversion: 5% (weak product-market fit)
- Churn: 5%/month (poor retention)
- International expansion stalls (regulatory issues)
- Apple launches competing product (2026 vs 2027)

**Outcome:**

| Year | Users | Revenue | Net Income | Valuation |
|------|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 2027 | 20M | $150M | -$50M | $500M |
| 2030 | 500M | $5B | $1B | $25B |

**Key Difference:** 0.1x revenue vs base case (major delays, weak PMF)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Pivot to B2B if consumer fails (enterprise AI inference)
- Reduce burn rate (cut S&M by 50%)
- Extend runway via Series C (raise $500M)

---
